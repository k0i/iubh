# Terms and Basics in IT Project Management

## Project Concept and Types of IT Projects

### Project Definition

##### Project

A project is characterized by temporality of engagement resources in delivering unique product, service, or results within already given budget.

- `Project boundaries` identify what belong to a project and what is outside of a project.
- `Project deliverable` is the final result of a project that are provided to project user, and they must meet all agreed requirements.
- `Project requirements` are what customers want to be included in a project.

##### Project constraints

Many factors can affect a project, especially basic project basic dimensions:

- Scope, representing a set of requirements that the project must include in the final deliverable.
- Costs, representing approved budget for the implementation of the project.
- Schedule, representing approved timeline for the implementation of the project.

These 3 dimensions are part of the triple constraint (triangle) framework.

### Projects vs operations

In the example of a new car design, you may find the difference between projects and operations you can find.  
If your automotive company decides to start with a new car design, they will for a project management team who will work on new design technical specifications and prototypes.  
After some period, they will produce technical specifications and a new car prototype. These can be considered as project deliverables.  
After these deliverables are accepted by the management of the company, they will provide technical specifications to the operations department who will start regular mass production of the new car model.  
As a result of the project, unique output (car prototype with new design and technical specification) is obtained within a limited period.  
As a result of business operations, standard output (mass-produced car) is obtained through regular day-to-day efforts.

Both projects and operations are working together to achieve concrete business value.  
This can be increased profitability, improved internal processes, proving new services, and similar.

## IT Project Lifecycle

### Product vs Project Lifecycle

Managing Product Lifecycle is a part of Operations Management, while managing Project Lifecycle is a part of Project Management. However, these cycles are intertwined.  
Products usually go through different stages:

- Introduction, in which a new product/service is offered to the market.  
  It is still not fully accepted by customers, thus operations managers together with marketing teams should work extensively to empower the position of a new product/service.
- Growth, in which a new product/service is becoming recognized, and more customers want to use the product/service.
- Maturity, in which a product/service is well positioned on the market with stable customers but without many opportunities for further growth.
- Decline, in which a product/service starts losing its market position.

---

Before you start with the production of your standard product, selling your service, the product/service must be developed.
The initial development of the product/service is done before introducing this product or service to the market, and it is done through project management.  
Once you develop a new unique product/service, this project deliverable (prototype, technical specification, etc) is being transferred to the operations department to start producing the product on a mass scale after which the product/service begins its life cycle.  
During different phases of the product/service life cycle, the company can decide to add some new features to the product/service as a part of their product/growth strategies to address the customers’ needs.  
Developing new product/service products is conducted within project management.  
During the maturity phase, and especially during the decline phase of the product/service life cycle, the company should re-establish its position to stay competitive with its product on the market.  
Thus, through project management, a revision of the product/service can be considered (e.g., a new model of iPhone).

### Project Lifecycle

There are 6 phases in the project lifecycle.

![Снимок экрана_2023-01-09_09-10-31](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100127291/211249535-c73cf36f-8627-4309-b2f0-5d333a1fd922.png)

---

Furthermore, in the project management literature, one can find different approaches to developing projects.

#### Predictive approach

This approach assumes a clear and predictive sequence of steps in developing a project.  
One phase should be finished before starting the next phase.  
This approach requires extensive planning efforts in advance enabling the project team to follow welldefined actions.

#### Incremental approach

In this approach, at the beginning of a project, there is only a general concept of what should be delivered at the end.  
However, detailed planning is done through increments or serious plan-design-build steps.  
Thus, it follows a step-by-step approach but in this approach project team divides the development of project deliverables into specific components that have adequate functionality.

#### Adaptive approach

The adaptive approach is not fully focused on project plans and sequencing of project tasks.  
It is rather focused on constant communication with project users and other stakeholders to constantly review a piece of project deliverable developed during one iteration.  
This enables early warnings on any deviation in developing of project deliverable through every iteration and putting the development of the project in the right direction according to the customer/user needs.  
Having in mind these specificities of the adaptive approach, at the beginning of the project team has only a vision and objectives of what should be delivered without in-depth plans.

![Снимок экрана_2023-01-09_09-14-42](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100127291/211250007-c2db61ec-17fe-420b-af63-f76118c6cb6c.png)

### Traditional and agile project methodologies

##### Traditional methodologies

It delivers projects by following pre-defined well-structured plans.  
Once these plans are designed, the project team must follow the sequence of activities prescribed in the plans.
This methodology enables you to estimate your project budget, duration of the project and develop a very detailed scope baseline at the early beginning of a project.  
This situation enables project companies to make a very precise contractual relation with the project user in the case of external projects.  
Furthermore, a project team has a very clear path in executing project tasks.  
However, the main disadvantage of this methodology lies in the challenge to implement changes during the execution of a project.

##### Agile methodologies

It delivers projects by following a vision and objectives that a project must meet.  
There are no detailed plans at the beginning, rather only a general framework of what project deliverable must provide.  
Planning activities are focused only on a small portion of work, and planning is done through short-term period iterations that are focused only on the tasks to be performed in the next iteration.  
This methodology is based on constant communication with project users and enables the implementation of changes with fewer costs.  
For this methodology, it is very difficult to estimate the budget and duration and develop a detailed scope baseline.  
It is also very challenging to manage contractual relations with project users.

---

For those products or services that you should know in advance of the final solution of project deliverable, the `traditional approach` in managing projects is more appropriate.  
When you start developing new software, you know what the purpose of the software is, but you are not familiar with all solutions that should be part of the project deliverable at the beginning of the project.  
In several iterations, you will add some additional features to your project (new coding) and you will check whether they are working or not.  
Thus, an `agile methodology` for many IT projects is more appropriate.

## Multi-Project Management – the Project in the Context of the Organization

### Project portfolio

When a project organization manages multiple projects, then it should have a systematic approach in this process.  
This is done within the project portfolio function.

Now as we know what a project portfolio is, we should define project portfolio management.

> “Portfolio management is an approach to achieving strategic goals by selecting, prioritizing, assessing, and managing projects, programs, and other related work based upon their alignment and contribution to the organization's strategies and objectives.”

From this definition, we can identify the role of portfolio management within two different statuses of projects:

- Before the activation and execution of projects in which portfolio management is focused on adequate selection and prioritization of projects
- During the execution of projects in which portfolio management is focused on alignment and contribution of projects towards strategic objectives by implementing monitoring tools and conducting measures to keep projects on the right track.

### Project governance

- It is a system that supports the management of projects
- It clarifies the responsibilities for governing or organization’s projects
- It represents a framework of policies and procedures about managing projects.
- It is also a structure within an organization that is responsible for project business.

---

Organizations that are delivering projects usually have a project management office (PMO) or project management unit (PMU) that is fully focused on projects with permanent staff.  
There are three main forms of PMOs, and their characteristics are shown in the following table.

![Снимок экрана_2023-01-09_09-47-01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100127291/211253691-a4b99a91-e9d4-4639-8aa4-7e73d3cda917.png)

# Plannning Techniques

## Planning on a Large Scale: Milestones, Sub-tasks, Work Packages

#### Project scope

It includes all features that must be included into project deliverable.

#### Scope statement

A scope statement is a general description of what is a project scope written with the SMART approach.
Thus, this description must be written in a specific (S) way enabling measurement (M) of achievements, at the same time attenable (A) and relevant (R) to project objectives with a specific time (T) for achievement.

#### Work-breakdown Structure (WBS)

`Work breakdown structure` is a tool that decomposes scope statement into more precise deliverables (features), and even deeper to the level of individual activities.  
In a work breakdown structure, the process of decomposing should go to the level of individual tasks/activities for which you can estimate duration and dependencies among activities, needed resources, and costs.

![Снимок экрана_2023-01-10_04-43-47](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100127291/211442942-703d63ba-ef5e-4f6e-a557-57fb17bf81c4.png)

## Planning in the Big Picture: Gantt Charts

#### Identification of activities

After decomposition of the project scope using the Work Breakdown structure, we can identify all the tasks/activities that should be conducted in the project.  
All these tasks found at the lowest level of WBS should be listed in the activity list.

![Снимок экрана_2023-01-10_04-57-32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100127291/211444524-0e6e7457-7521-4398-aee7-1c4f440f2b81.png)

#### Estimation of duration

Before you construct the schedule of your project, you should estimate the duration for each individual task. There are several methods for estimation of duration.

- `Analogues` estimating uses historical data about duration of tasks on similar projects and replicate estimation on a new project.
- `Parametric` estimating uses historical data as a parameter for estimation of duration on the task on new project.
- `Three-point` estimating uses three different scenarios of duration for each activity.

  1. O - Optimistic (best case scenario)
  2. P- Pessimistic (worst case scenario)
  3. ML - Mostly likely scenario

---

After these scenarios are identified for each task, you apply one of these formulae to estimate the duration for a particular activity:

- Triangular distribution  
  $Estimation = O + P + ML /3$

- Beta distribution  
  $Estimation = O + P + 4ML /6$

When you estimate the duration for each activity, NOTE that the total duration of the project IS NOT EQUAL to the sum of the duration of all activities.  
The total duration of your project will be identified after the network diagram is developed and a critical path is found.

#### Sequence activities

There are 4 types of dependencies between the tasks:

- Mandatory dependency (hard logic) shows sequential relations between two tasks that must be applied due to physical and other laws (example: you must finish house foundation before start building the walls).
- Discretionary dependency (soft logic) shows sequential relations between two tasks that can be applied due to lessons learned from previous experience (example: it is better to finish house foundation before the winter starts).
- Internal dependency that is under the control of project team (example: organizing working shifts).
- External dependency that is not under the direct control of project team (example: issuing construction permit by the government).

#### Immediate predecessor

It is the activity that must be finished before some activity starts

#### Dependency relationships

There are 3 main dependency relationships between the tasks:

##### Finish-to-start (FS)

in which task A must finish before you start with task B. These tasks cannot be done in overlapping.

![Снимок экрана_2023-01-10_05-05-29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100127291/211445479-58f0d02b-7f0e-4007-ab28-dbdd90c42e73.png)

##### Start-to-start (SS)

in which task A must start to start with task B. These tasks can be done in overlapping but the precondition is to start with task A.

![Снимок экрана_2023-01-10_05-06-04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100127291/211445538-384e6985-4f7a-4f2d-92a3-b58766ceb1e9.png)

##### Finish-to-finish (FF)

in which task A must finish finishing task B. These tasks can also be done in overlapping.  
So, there are no dependencies on starting date. However, the precondition to finish task B is to finish task A

![Снимок экрана_2023-01-10_05-06-30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100127291/211445580-0c5bba37-5d02-4cfd-b09f-1be3885caf7a.png)

#### Network diagram

Once you establish dependencies between different tasks and identify an immediate predecessor for each task, the next step is to construct a network diagram.  
A network diagram is a visual representation of dependencies between different tasks.

![Снимок экрана_2023-01-10_05-07-25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100127291/211445672-952f30de-7202-4ff1-b67c-7f7f3c569780.png)

![Снимок экрана_2023-01-10_05-07-13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100127291/211445680-5c02a1f6-aac6-4514-8bdf-b446afa3f686.png)

#### Critical path

After the network diagram is developed, it is time to identify all possible paths (sequence of activities) and to determine the path with the longest duration.  
This path is called the critical path and it represents the shortest possible duration of the project regardless of the duration of other paths or sequence of activities.  
In project management practice, you should pay special attention to the tasks on the critical path.  
In case of any delays on the tasks on the critical path, it will cause delays for the entire project.  
However, in case of some delays on the tasks that belong to the non-critical path, this does not necessarily mean it will cause a delay of the entire project.  
The reason can be found in slack time that is present on the non-critical path.  
If delays on the non-critical path are less than the total duration of the critical path, the total duration of the entire project will remain the same.

![Снимок экрана_2023-01-10_05-20-52](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100127291/211447248-7175d896-9fa1-459e-a7fc-7caded54685b.png)

- 1st Path: A(2) -> C(3) -> F(4) -> H(2) = 11 days
- 2nd Path: A(2) -> D(3) -> F(4) -> H(2) = 11 days

---

The previous example shows us the existence of 2 critical paths (1st and 2nd) with the duration of 11 days each.  
Thus, the total duration of the project cannot be less than 11 days.

# Prioritization, Effort Estimation, Project Controlling

## Prioritization

Project and portfolio management must work together.  
While project management is about the implementation of different methods and tools that will enable the successful delivery of individual projects from their beginning to closing,  
portfolio management is responsible for managing portfolios.  
A portfolio is a collection of projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations managed as a group to achieve strategic objectives.
![Снимок экрана_2023-01-11_12-46-20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100127291/211773315-0c9a3290-27de-48e1-b49b-633643d358bd.png)
![Снимок экрана_2023-01-11_12-46-35](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100127291/211773325-11c90606-fb76-4a23-90cd-baf5db545edd.png)

> While project management is about doing the selected projects right, project portfolio management helps us to do the right projects

### Organizational strategy and project alignment

![Снимок экрана_2023-01-11_12-55-39](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100127291/211775204-40ad8b1c-e051-476c-87b4-86e2f13f13a2.png)

- Evaluate whether the proposed project is aligned with strategic objectives.  
  Only those projects that are aligned with strategic objectives should be considered for implementation.
- Assessing whether and at what level the project delivers some specific value (strategic impact, profit, benefit, net present value, etc.).  
  This can be done using different tools and techniques.  
  If the project does not achieve some threshold value indicated in advance, it should not be considered for implementation.
- Prioritizing the projects based on specific criteria using different methods.  
  This enables you to create a waiting list for funds and resources for the project implementation.

### Project selection and prioritization

While selecting projects, the most important task is to define selection criteria.

![Снимок экрана_2023-01-11_13-02-20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100127291/211776718-4c53de04-5b72-466a-8764-7f1914a49006.png)

---

The action priority matrix categorizes projects into 4 different categories according to the level of effort in the execution of the project and the project impact:

- Fill-ins, that require low effort and the impact of these projects is also very low.  
  Usually, these types of projects are not considered for execution.
- Thankless tasks, that require high effort with a low impact.  
  These projects should be avoided since you can spend a serious effort in their implementation for low-value projects.
- Quick wins, that require a low effort but the impact is very high.  
  These are the best projects but you will not find them very often.  
  But, when these projects are offered, you should grab them immediately.
- Major projects, that require high efforts with high impact.  
  These projects will provide you with the greatest benefits, but the complexity and the level of resource engagement are also very challenging.

![Снимок экрана_2023-01-11_13-02-07](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100127291/211776689-3fef1b70-ac98-4fc4-91cd-7e8b73db7263.png)

### Portfolio Optimization

Portfolio optimization „is the process of making a portfolio as effective as possible by maximizing available conditions, constraints, and resources.
There are different types of project optimization.

- Cost-Value Optimization is focused on using the budget in the most effective way delivering the biggest value from the project portfolio.  
  Thus, this type of optimization is about the creation of a mix of projects that can deliver the highest value with the same level of budget.
- Work Type Optimization is focused on the assessment of minimum and maximum levels of investment per project or project category.  
  This enables the definition of the investment ranges for project categories that can be balanced across them.
- Resource Optimization is focused on the human resource capacity of the project organization.  
  It assesses the resources utilization of each project member for each project.  
  This type of optimization enables a similar resources utilization level throughout the year avoiding fluctuation of the utilization with periods of underutilization and overutilization.
- Supply and Demand optimization is focused to enable external resources just in time when they are needed for project execution.  
  This requires inter-project assessment of the scope baseline and needed resources (material, equipment) for their execution.
- Schedule Optimization is focused on tasks dependencies between multiple projects.  
  Beyond project scheduling that enables adequate sequencing of tasks, schedule optimization can affect individual project tasks in order to put them into an interproject dependent view,  
  thus making portfolio execution more efficient from the time perspective.

## Effort Estimation

### Estimation techniques

##### Expert judgment techniques

Expert judgment techniques are subjective methods. The most common methods are Expert judgment and the Delphi technique.
Expert judgment techniques include subject matter experts who have practical experience in similar projects.  
These experts provide their estimation of the efforts needed to execute the project tasks and the costs.  
The Delphi technique is similar but unlike the previous, with this method, it is expected to reach a consensus on the estimation from several experts.
Thus, this can be considered a moderated expert judgment technique.

##### Analogous estimating

Analogous estimating is a very simple technique to estimate efforts and costs based on previous similar projects.  
This technique uses historical data from previous projects. Like analogous, parametric estimating is used when your project is similar by characteristics but not in the size to previous projects.  
Thus, this technique uses a specific algorithm to re-calculate efforts and costs for the new project.

##### The three-Point Estimating trchnique

The three-Point Estimating technique takes into consideration several scenarios: optimistic (cO), pessimistic (cP), and most likely (cM) to estimate the efforts and costs for each activity.  
This technique considers risks that can occur causing positive or negative effects on the estimation.  
Once three scenarios for each activity are estimated, the final estimation for each task is calculated with one of the following equations,  
by using a triangular distribution

$$
cE = cO + cM + cP ÷ 3
$$

or by using a Beta distribution

$$
cE = c0 + 4 \* cM + cP ÷ 6
$$

![Снимок экрана_2023-01-11_13-10-57](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100127291/211778501-fee043c7-33aa-4d48-a9cb-18661ec9a8b1.png)

## Project Controlling

During the execution of the project, the occurrence of deviation from the project plan, known as project creep, is possible.  
There are many forms of project creeps, and `scope creep` is the most common.  
Scope creep represents any change in the project scope that was not given by the original plan and not officially approved and added to the project plan.  
It is ‘‘any uncontrolled and unexpected changes in project requirement that extend the initial boundaries of the project’’ .  
Several authors argue that scope creep is the most common reason for the failure of software projects.  
More concretely, scope creep occurs when the project management team or/and the customer are not aware of the changes on the project, in case of the absence of an agreement that changes should be implemented and there is no official review of the change impact on the project.  
A very similar to scope creep is `feature creep`, known as `Gold Plating`.  
Gold plating when a project organization intentionally add some additional features to the project deliverable believing that it will be beneficial for the customer, but without previous agreement with them.  
However, you never know whether this new feature will be acceptable for the customer.

---

For scope control, two major processes are implemented:

- Scope control by continuously assessing any deviation of actual and planned performances
- Scope validation by the inspection conducted by a customer that should lead to formal acceptance of a project. In the agile type of project, scope validation is conducted on a regular basis.

### Earned value management

- Cost Variance (CV) = Earned Value (EV) - Actual Cost (AC)
- Schedule Variance (SV) = Earned Value – Planned Value (PV)
- Cost Performance Index (CPI) = Earned Value (EV) ÷ Actual Costs (AC)
- Schedule Performance Index (SPI) = Earned Value (EV) ÷ Planned Value (PV)

- Cost Variance (CV) gives us information on whether the project is on planned costs (CV=0), over planned costs (CV - positive value), or less than planned costs (CV - negative value).
- Similar information is given by Cost Performance Indicators (CPI=1-on planned costs, CPI >1-over planned costs, CPI < 1 -less than planned costs).
- Schedule Variance (SV) gives us information on whether the project is on the planned schedule (SV=0), ahead of schedule (SV - positive value), and behind the schedule (SV - negative value).
- Similar information is given by Schedule Performance Indicators (SPI=1-on planned schedule, SPI >1-ahead of schedule, SPI < 1 -behind the schedule).

In case there are deviations, this can be reflected in serious delays and overrunning project costs.  
Having previous information, we are able to compute:

- Estimate at Completion (EAC) represents the expectation of the real project costs taking into consideration current deviations.  
  This gives you valuable information on whether you will need more or less budget than was initially planned. It is calculated as follows

$$
  EAC = BAC ÷ CPI
$$

# Stakeholder, Communication and Risk Management

## Stakeholder Management

There are two major types of stakeholders:

###### Internal stakeholders

Internal stakeholders are individuals and groups inside the project organization.  
The most important internal stakeholders are the project sponsor, project manager, and project team.  
A project sponsor is very often considered the most important stakeholder who financially supports the project.  
It can be considered an investor.Very often this is a general manager in the company.  
However, very often project sponsor is an external stakeholder who wants some project to be delivered by the project organization (e.g. national government).  
A project manager is the most responsible stakeholder for the successful execution of the project.  
He is responsible to implement and control project plans and leading a project team.  
A project team is a group of skilled professionals, usually from different areas of expertise (finance, engineeing, procurement) who work on the project.

###### External stakeholders

External stakeholders are individuals and groups outside the project organization.  
Among them, we have suppliers who supply project teams with necessary project inputs (raw material, sub-components, etc).  
Any disruption of supplies can affect delays in the project causing serious problems for the project.  
Customers are those who pay for the project deliverable.  
They need must be respected within the agreed scope to avoid the situation of non-acceptance of final deliverables.  
Governmental agencies create an adequate environment for project business.  
Very often project start date depends on in+ssing some permissions and licenses from the governmental agencies.  
A wider community should never be forgotten as a stakeholder. Very often they are the final user, and sometimes the project can affect their interests.

### Managing stakeholders

![Снимок экрана_2023-01-12_06-43-02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100127291/211970722-792d9e22-98ec-46ee-9a1b-2072def10e50.png)

- Stakeholders with low interest and low power where minimum effort in managing stakeholders is needed.  
  The best strategy for these stakeholders is to monitor them, and only if some issue arises, properly react.
- Stakeholders with high interest but low power.  
  These stakeholders should be informed about the project‘s progress in order to keep them in favor of the project and not resistant.
- Stakeholders with high power but low interest.  
  The best strategy for these stakeholders is to keep them satisfied. Depending on the situation, if their support is needed, a project manager should try to improve their level of interest for the projects.
- Stakeholders with high power and high interest. These are the most important stakeholders and they need to be managed very closely.

---

Regardless of their level of interest and power, stakeholders can be classified according to their level of engagement in the project:

- Unaware stakeholders who are not informed about the project or the project effect.
- Resistant stakeholders who are not supportive of the project, rather they represent an opposition.
- Neutral stakeholders who have no positive or negative standpoint toward the project.
- Supportive stakeholders who provide their support in the execution of the project.

## Communication Management

- Interactive communication that enables two-way interaction in real-time. This method is especially advisable in meetings, video conferencing, etc.
- Push communication is when communication is sent to the receiver, usually by emails or reports, or press releases.  
  This method enables project organizations to reach many message receivers in a short time span.  
  The challenge of this method is that you are not sure whether the message is received and well understood by the receiver.
- Pull communication enables receivers to access some information when they want.  
  This method uses some forms of information depositories such as intranet sites, shared folders, etc.

### Communication in agile projects

IT projects are very specific and require constant communication.  
Very often SCRUM methodology is applied to the IT project in which communication is the key management tool.

Within the iterative process of project development (known as sprints), constant communication is achieved through different format meetings:

- Sprint Planning Meeting when the project team discusses the amount of work to be performed within the sprint.  
  This meeting usually takes several hours, and it is organized before each sprint.
- Daily Scrum meeting is organized every day for a maximum of 15 minutes to report any open issue.
- Sprint Review Meeting is organized to present the progress of the sprint and discuss necessary changes.
- Sprint Retrospective Meeting enables open discussion within the team about teamwork and organizational constraints for the project.
- Backlog Refinement Meeting enables a discussion on the quality of work on theproject.

## Risk Management

### Risk definition

Risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, can have a positive or negative effect.  
From this definition, it is clear that any uncertain event about the project can be identified as a risk, regardless of whether it can positively or negatively affect the project.

##### Risk appetite

It is the level of taking the risks taking by the risks taking by could be realized in the event that the risk is not realized  
 Depending on the level of risks tolerance or risks appetite, there are two major types of project managers:

- Risks-takers, whose risks appetite and willingness to accept risks are higher
- Risks-avoiders, whose risks appetite and willingness to accept risks are lower

### Risk Identification

Knowing your unknowns (risks) is very important to decrease the level of uncertainty.  
So, we can state that the risks are unknown. Those unknowns that can be identified are called “known unknowns”.  
Once these risks are identified, you can evaluate them, create an adequate risks response strategy, and assign some level of risks reserves in the project budget.  
These risks reserves are called `contingency reserves` and can be estimated in monetary value in terms of the probability and impact of risk.  
However, there are some risks that you cannot identify, and they will be treated as “unknown unknowns”.  
Even for these types of non-identified risks, the project budget can allocate a certain amount of funds within `management reserves`.  
These reserves are not estimated for identified risks, rather they represent the additional percentage of the project budget for “just-in-case” situations.

### Monetary effects of risks

For appropriate management of project risks, it is necessary to allocate an adequate amount of money into contingency reserves of the project budget.  
To estimate contingency reserves the most appropriate method is Expected Monetary Value (EMV).  
EMV calculates contingency reserves by adding EMVs for each individual risk that is calculated by multiplying the probability by the impact:

$$
EMV = Probability in nominal value × Impact (in monetary value)
$$

# Organization and Structure of IT Projects?

## PRINCE2 - Overview and Selected Processes

PRINCE2 is a process-based project methodology and it is widely used in many sectors across the globe. The framework of this methodology is composed of:

##### 7 Principles

- Continued business justification: this implies that only those projects that have justification, otherwise it is waste of time, and these non-justifiable projects should not be considered for the implementation.
- Learn from experience: this focuses project teams on lessons learned from previous projects that should be taken into consideration in future projects.
- Defined roles and responsibilities: this requires a clear organizational structure and clear definition of responsibilities for project tasks.
- Manage by stages: this sets this methodology as a perfect solution for IT projects in which there is a need to implement an incremental approach.
- Manage by exception: this requires some level of authority and independence of project team members in performing project tasks.
- Focus on products: this focused project team on adequate identification of project requirements and their delivery.
- Adjustment to the project environment: this assumes that the project management methodology must suit different project environments and be adaptable.]

##### 7 Themes,

- Business case enables a project team to achieve one of the principles of PRINCE2 methodology which is the justification of the project.  
  A business case provides the full information necessary for the project team to understand whether the implementation of the project is justifiable. A business case should be verified and approved to initiate the project.
- Organization theme defines the project structure with clear roles of project team members in dealing with specific project tasks.  
  This theme also goes beyond of specification of project team structure. It also defines the way of delivery and communication on the project.
- Quality theme identifies customer requirements that the project team must achieve to satisfy their needs. Thus, it is necessary to transpose customers‘ requirements into the project scope.  
  This theme also covers the definition of metrics and measures to control the level of achievement of requested quality.
- Plans enable the identification of all the steps in the execution of the project. They provide information on which tasks should be executed, the methods of execution, the timeline, and the responsibility for their execution.
- Risk theme focuses on the uncertainty within the project environment. It identifies and assesses the effect of different risks, including positive (threats) and positive (opportunities).
- Change theme assumes there will be some changes during the execution of a project. This is because some unknowns are present at the early beginning of the project.  
  This theme introduces the way how to assess and manage changes in projects.
- Progress theme enables adequate monitoring and controlling of project plan execution. It uses performance metrics to provide adequate information for decisionmaking during the execution of a project.

##### 7 Processes.

- Starting a Project
- Initiating a Project
- Directing a Project
- Managing a Stage Boundary
- Controlling a Stage
- Managing Product Delivery
- Closing a Project

##### Project Roles

According to the PRINCE2 methodology, there are different project roles:

- Project Board consists of several stakeholders who are ultimate decision-makers and have the highest influence on a project.  
  This Board includes Executive from the project company, Senior Users who are final users of the project output, and Senior Suppliers who are the main suppliers for the project.
- Project Assurance enables assurance of smooth project deliverables and provides information on the project progress to the Project Board.  
  In addition to reporting to the Project Board by a project manager, due to possible subjectivity in reporting a new role of Project Assurance is introduced.  
  Project Assurance is performed by Project Board itself or delegated to a third party.
- Change Authority, an individual or a group formed by the Project Board to assess and decide on change requests.
- Project Manager is a person assigned by the Project Board to conduct the daily management of a project.
- Project Support performs administrative support to the Project Manager in performing project tasks.  
  This includes supporting tasks such as administrative support, or some specialized support such as risk management.
- Team Manager is an optional role that is used on larger projects when specialized skills are needed. This role is responsible for the production of the product.
